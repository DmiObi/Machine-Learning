As a result of taking Introduction to Machine Learning, I learned many machine learning algorithms and models such as linear regression, kNN regression, logistic regression, kNN classification, Naive Bayes, decision trees,  neural network classification, keras classification, 
Bayesian networks, Markov Models, and reinforcement learning. Learning all those algorithms and models helped me realize that every data set is different and sometimes you need to choose one algorithm over the other if it works better for that specific dataset. I especially enjoyed implementing some of the algorithms myself. For example, I built a Native Base model to predict if the person would survive the Titanic crash. Implementing models helped me understand models on a much deeper level as I gained a better picture of what the algorithm is actually doing. I also learned a new language, R, as well as strengthened my skills in Python as those were the primary languages that I used for my projects during this course. I definitely see so much potential in machine learning and I think that the knowledge I gained from this class, will help me build more advanced projects as well as it will help me later on in my career.
